                <p>The People's Republic of Bangladesh (Bengali: গণপ্রজাতন্ত্রী বাংলাদেশ; romanised: Gônôprôjatôntri Bangladesh) is a nation in South Asia, on the edge of the Indian subcontinent. It is nearly completely surrounded by India, but it also has a small land border with Myanmar.

                    Bangladesh is one of the most ethnically homogeneous countries in the world, with Bengalis making up 98% of the population. It has the world's highest population density (excepting microstates/city-states). The vast majority of Bengalis (91.04%) in Bangladesh are Sunni Muslims and the country has one of the largest Muslim populations in the world.
                    
                    After independence from the British Raj, Bangladesh became a part of Pakistan during the partition of India in 1947. In 1971, it became an independent nation.
                    
                    Endowed with pristine beaches, numerous archaeological sites, bustling markets, numerous sites of religious importance, forests, delicious food, and more importantly, hospitable and friendly people, there's plenty to do and see in Bangladesh. <br> <br> <br> <b>SOME OF THE POPULAR PLACES IN BANGLADESH ARE:- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#">Dhaka</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#">Chittagong</a> </b>
